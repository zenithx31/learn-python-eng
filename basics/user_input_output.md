# Python Input and Output - User Input and Output

## ðŸ“š Input

The `input()` function is used to receive input from the user.

```python
a = input()
```

This code waits for the user to type something on the keyboard when the program runs.

For example, if the user types "Hello World", the input value is stored in the variable `a`.

```python
a = input()  # Receive user input
print(a)     # Print the input value
```

**Output**

```
Hello World
```

Note that `input()` always returns a string.

## ðŸ“š Print

The `print()` function is used to display output.

It is useful for showing information on the screen or debugging.

---

### 1) Concatenating strings in output

```python
print("Hello" "World")
```

**Output**

```
HelloWorld
```

In this code, `"Hello"` and `"World"` are printed without any spaces between them.

In Python, adjacent string literals behave like the `+` operator and are concatenated automatically.

---

### 2) Adding spaces between strings

If you want to add a space between strings, use a comma (`,`) inside the `print()` function.

```python
print("Hello", "World")
```

**Output**

```
Hello World
```

Using a comma automatically inserts a space between the strings.

---

### 3) Printing multiple values on the same line

You can print multiple values on the same line using a `for` loop.

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i, end=' ')
```

**Output**

```
0 1 2 3 4
```
