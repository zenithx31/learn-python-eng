~~~python
import datetime

datetime_str = '2023-11-08 16:00:00'
format = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
datetime_dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(datetime_str, format)
print(datetime_dt)
print(type(datetime_dt))
# Output:
# 2023-11-08 16:00:00
# <class 'datetime.datetime'>
~~~

2. **Converting datetime to string**

~~~python
import datetime

datetime_str = '2023-11-08 16:00:00'
format = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
datetime_dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(datetime_str, format)

datetime_str = datetime_dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
print(datetime_str)
print(type(datetime_str))
# Output:
# 2023-11-08 16:00:00
# <class 'str'>
